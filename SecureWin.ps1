.SYNOPSIS
    Blue Team Windows Hardening Script for CDT Competition - Team Alpha Spring 2026
.DESCRIPTION
    Comprehensive hardening script designed for Blue vs Red team competitions.
    Removes unauthorized users, hardens SSH, configures firewall, and locks down the system
    while preserving competition infrastructure through whitelisting.
    
    COMPETITION: CDT Team Alpha Spring 2026
    DOMAIN: mlp.local
    DEFAULT PASSWORD: FriendshipIsMagic0!
    SCORING ENGINE: https://172.20.0.100:443
    
.BEFORE_RUNNING
    **REQUIRED CONFIGURATION - EDIT THESE VARIABLES:**
    
    1. $AuthorizedAdmins (Line ~48) - Add your blue team usernames
       Example: @("blueteam1", "blueteam2", "blueteam3")
    
    2. $SetAllUserPasswords (Line ~56) - Change to YOUR secure password
       Example: "YourTeamPassword2026!Secure"
       NOTE: Avoid using # symbol - use ! @ $ % ^ & * instead
    
    3. $SafeIPAddresses (Line ~61) - Verify scoring engine/jumpbox IPs
       (Default values should work for CDT competition)
    
    **OPTIONAL:** Review $SafeUsers (Line ~27) to ensure all competition users are protected
    
.CRITICAL_RULES
